      //I want to write a code that ask a user to input the number of rows and columns he/she want then my code will go further to ask what they want to be at diffrent location of the rows and columns

      //the first thing i did was to get these values from the user through a prompt and storing them in input1 and input2 respectively below
      	var input1 = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number of row(s) you want"));
    	  var input2 = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number of column(s) you want"));
    	
      //when i got that I created a multidimentional array row bello without specifing the number of element it will have yet to be determined in subsequent for loop bellow
    	 var row = [];

       //this for loop takes its condition to be the lenght of the input1 being the number of rows added by the user so when ever the value of i is less than input1 enter this code again and exexute the next possible value for example the user choose 2rows this will loop two times for subscript 0 and 1
          for (var i = 0; i < input1; i++) {
              row[i] = [];
      //this for loop takes its condition to be the lenght of the input2 being the number of columns added by the user so when ever the value of j is less than input2 enter this code again and exexute the next possible value for example the user choose 3columns this will loop three times for subscript 0, 1 and 2 but in the case of row[i][j] means fro every i lets assume it's 0 subscript the below code will prompt for [0][0] [0][1] [0][2] and this goes again for [1][0] [1][1] [1][2] and you have your 2 by 3 table
          	     for (var j = 0; j < input2 ; j++) {
          	       row[i][j] = prompt("Please enter value for row "+ i +" coloumn " + j);

          	     }

      //then its time to write our table in our document

      //hear row.lenght is the lenght of the rows
              for (var i = 0; i < row.length; i++) {

    	        document.write("<tr>");
      //hear row[i].lenght is the number of columns and pointing at element i in row main array
